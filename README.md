In the 'Hotel Booking Prediction' project, the focus is on providing users with an accurate forecast of booking cancellations, allowing them to gain early insights into hotel booking-related matters. The impact of booking cancellations on revenue is substantial, influencing crucial decision-making in the hospitality industry. To mitigate this effect, the project employs a machine learning-based cancellation model as a key solution. By integrating data science tools and capabilities with human judgment, the project aims to showcase how predictive analysis can effectively address the challenge of booking cancellation forecasting.
Additionally, the project endeavours to offer users seeking accommodation in a specific hotel a comprehensive prediction and analysis. Through the implementation of various algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and others, along with the use of Evaluation Matrices to categorize data, users can obtain predictions tailored to their desired level of accuracy. This approach not only benefits hotels by minimizing the impact of cancellations but also ensures a smoother experience for tourists, preventing issues related to room availability. Users or customers input specific information, enabling the model to make accurate predictions regarding cancellations.
