ABSTRACT
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the 'Hotel Booking Prediction' project, the focus is on providing users with an accurate forecast of booking cancellations, allowing them to gain early insights into hotel booking-related matters. The impact of booking cancellations on revenue is substantial, influencing crucial decision-making in the hospitality industry. To mitigate this effect, the project employs a machine learning-based cancellation model as a key solution. By integrating data science tools and capabilities with human judgment, the project aims to showcase how predictive analysis can effectively address the challenge of booking cancellation forecasting.
Additionally, the project endeavours to offer users seeking accommodation in a specific hotel a comprehensive prediction and analysis. Through the implementation of various algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and others, along with the use of Evaluation Matrices to categorize data, users can obtain predictions tailored to their desired level of accuracy. This approach not only benefits hotels by minimizing the impact of cancellations but also ensures a smoother experience for tourists, preventing issues related to room availability. Users or customers input specific information, enabling the model to make accurate predictions regarding cancellations.

INTRODUCTION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hotels play a crucial role for travellers, whether local or international, as they journey from one destination to another. These establishments offer essential services such as parking, food, room service, and personalized offerings based on customer preferences. Hotels actively seek valuable feedback from guests to uphold their reputation in the city or area. The quality of services directly influences hotel bookings; poor services result in lower bookings, while excellent services lead to increased reservations.
In this predictive model, we assess the likelihood of hotel bookings based on various factors and also attempt to anticipate any special requests users might have, considering different features. The dataset employed in this project encompasses both international and local hotel data. Utilizing popular Machine Learning Algorithms including Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, among others, we aim to predict the probability of hotel booking cancellations. The model achieves a prediction accuracy of approximately 95%.

PROBLEM STATEMENT

The challenge is to utilize guest data and discern booking behaviour patterns through a Machine Learning approach to formulate an effective strategy for Hotel Booking Management.
The escalating trend of last-minute hotel cancellations poses a growing concern for both local and international tourists. Currently, customers lack information regarding the likelihood of cancellations when booking a hotel.

SOLUTION

The proposed 'HOTEL BOOKING PREDICTION' seeks to empower users with insights into the cancellation percentages of hotels well in advance. Armed with this predictive information, users can make informed decisions about whether to proceed with their hotel/resort booking or not. Additionally, this tool enables hotel managers and revenue managers to proactively address bookings identified as "potentially going to be cancelled." The successful implementation of this predictive model is expected to significantly contribute to enhancing hotel revenue management strategies.

LITERATURE SURVEY

A. Machine Learning Classification for Predicting Hotel Booking Cancellations
In the contemporary world, hotel booking cancellations pose a common challenge that can result in substantial business losses. This report outlines the utilization of AI to discern cancellations, mitigating potential losses. 

B. Escalating Cancellation Rates in the Hotel Industry
While the upward trajectory of the hotel industry is advantageous, it brings challenges like a rising rate of cancellations. Users often cancel bookings based on reviews, and instances of poor treatment by hotel owners adversely impact reputation and lead to cancellations. The contemporary trend shows a growing expectation for superior accommodation, and any shortcomings result in negative ratings. The cancellation percentage has been steadily increasing, with a survey indicating a rise from under 33% in 2014 to 40% in 2018. The COVID-19 pandemic further exacerbated this trend as changing circumstances and lockdown implementations prompted sudden changes in travel plans, leading to increased cancellations.

C. Aspect-Based Sentiment-Oriented Summarization of Hotel Reviews
Customer reviews significantly influence a hotel's image and revenue system, yet many travellers do not read them all. This system analyses reviews and feedback, collected from the hotel's website and categorized as classes. The model identifies overlooked information, takes necessary steps based on the analysis, and conducts emotional assessments. Hotels can then make informed decisions to enhance their services.

D. Critical Review of Machine Learning Applications in the Hotel Industry
The gradual integration of the IT industry into the hotel sector is a noteworthy development. Researchers are actively exploring the application of new artificial intelligence technologies and learning tools in the hotel industry. This study provides insights into the utilization of machine learning and associated technologies in the hotel and tourism sector, highlighting the current trends in this rapidly evolving field.  


CONCLUSION
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
•	hotel_booking.csv dataset is a supervised classification dataset.

•	Among these four machine learning algorithms, Random forest and Decision trees perform well with respect to accuracy.

•	This models classifies whether or not a booking will be canceled with 95% and 94% accuracy.

•	Our EDA (Exploratory data analysis ) explain a non-refundable deposit and requiring parking spaces are the two features influencing cancellation prediction the most.

•	Our analysis also pointed at the importance of lead time, number of special requests, and room type.

•	we discovered that a deeper understanding of the situation may require additional hotel specific information (such as surrounding parking availability or deposit policies).

RECOMMENDATION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some recommendations to improve model performance with better accuracy of F1 prediction:

1. Feature Enrichment: Enhance the model by introducing new features or fields related to guest information. Consider incorporating variables like lead time, reservation time histories, and details about guest complaints. These additional features can provide richer insights into booking patterns and cancellation behaviors.
2. Algorithm Exploration: Experiment with alternative machine learning algorithms that may offer improved predictive performance. Regularly explore new algorithms to stay updated with advancements in the field. Additionally, fine-tune hyperparameters of the current model to optimize its performance.
3. Seasonal Adjustments: Account for seasonal variations, especially during holidays like Summer, Christmas, and New Year. Adjusting the model or implementing specialized models to handle holiday-specific trends can enhance prediction accuracy during these periods.
4. Error Analysis: Analyze instances where the model predicts incorrectly to identify patterns and reasons behind these inaccuracies. Understanding the characteristics of mispredictions can guide further refinements to the model, leading to increased accuracy and reliability.
By incorporating these strategies, the model can evolve and adapt to changing conditions, ensuring its effectiveness in predicting hotel booking cancellations.
